    <h1>Apple event announcements — iPhone 14, Apple Watch 8, AirPods Pro 2</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>September is here, which begs the annual question: Is it time to ditch your old iPhone for the shiny new one? The newly revealed $799 iPhone 14 and $999 iPhone 14 Pro are seriously promising devices, offering improved cameras and battery life across the board as well as some innovative new safety features that could save your life.

        But not all new iPhones are created equal, and this year marks perhaps the biggest difference yet between the standard iPhone and its “Pro” counterpart. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are the big standouts of the bunch, offering a faster processor, the most advanced iPhone camera yet and a new Dynamic Island feature that changes the way you interact with your iPhone.
        
        If that all sounds overwhelming, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a guide to who should upgrade to the iPhone 14, who should splurge for the iPhone 14 Pro and who can skip out on this year’s iPhones entirely.</p>

    <h2>You should upgrade to the iPhone 14 / iPhone 14 Pro / iPhone 14 Pro Max if…</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You’re a frequent driver — or outdoor explorer</li>
        <li>You want a big-screen phone (for a non-exorbitant price)</li>
        <li>You’re coming from an iPhone 11 or older</li>
        <li>You want something legitimately new</li>
        <li>You want the best camera possible in an iPhone</li>
        <li>You want the best possible performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>APPLE EVENT PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>iPhone 14:  The iPhone 14 isn't a big leap from the iPhone 13, and that includes the new phone's $799 (£849 / AU$1,399) price tag. It runs on an A15 system-on-chip as before, but Apple has turned to a 5-core GPU for improved performance over last year's phone. While the main camera is still 12MP, there's a bigger sensor for improved low-light photos.</li>
        <li>iPhone 14 Plus: Think of the iPhone 14 Plus as a larger version of the iPhone 14 (or a cheaper, not-as-fully-featured version of the iPhone 14 Pro Max). It's got a 6.7-inch screen and a bigger battery than the 6.1-inch iPhone 14, but otherwise, features are the same.</li>
        <li>iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max: Easily the biggest surprise of the day is the fact that iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max aren't getting the rumored $100 price increase. Instead, they'll cost $999 (£1,099 / AU$1,749) and $1,099 (£1,199 / AU$1,899), respectively. That's very impressive, considering the 4-nanometer A16 Bionic chipset that powers both phones and significant camera improvements, including a 48MP main shooter. The notch is gone, too, replaced by a cutout named Dynamic Island that incorporates animations and notifications.</li>
        <li>Apple Watch 8: Evolution not revolution is truly the aim with this watch, which starts at $399 (£419 / AU$649) for the GPS-only version. Big changes include a new temperature sensor, geared toward helping women with reproductive planning, and a low-power mode that doubles the battery life.</li>
        <li>Apple Watch SE (2022): Apple seems to be following the iPhone SE's naming structure by slapping a year rather than a number at the end of its less expensive entry-level device. The latest Apple Watch SE gets the crash detection and low-battery mode features found in the Apple Watch 8; its starting price also drops to $249 (£259 / AU$399).</li>
        <li>Apple Watch Ultra: Apple is opting for a different name than the rumored Apple Watch 8 Pro moniker that had been suggested for its rugged smartwatch. But the other expected features are in place, from a 49mm size to twice the baseline battery life. Apple is promising more precise GPS tracking as well. Apple Watch Ultra starts at $799 (£849 / AU$1,299), which is less than the rumored $999 price we were expecting.</li>
        <li>AirPods Pro 2: The $249 (£249 / AU$399) wireless earbuds get a new H2 chip along with a low-distortion audio driver and custom amplifier for improved sound. You'll be able to use the front camera on your iPhone to create a customized spatial audio profile, while other features like active noise cancellation have been improved. Battery life is now 6 hours of playback.</li>
    </ul>
